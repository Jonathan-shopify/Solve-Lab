They are found in nature, especially in mushrooms, and are known for their strong ability to support and regulate the immune system. [2]\n<br><br>\nBeta-D-glucans from mushrooms are considered to be more beneficial than those sourced from cereals like oats and barley, yeasts, or certain algae. This is due to their distinct structural features and the health advantages they offer. At Solve Labs, we exclusively utilise mushroom-sourced Beta-D-Glucans for these reasons.

Since we do not have an enzyme that can effectively digest chitin - hot water extraction is fundamental to the bioavailability of fungal preparations. Alcohol, on the other hand, allows the extraction of water-insoluble compounds such as triterpenes.<br\/><br\/>Once the extract has been concentrated, spray drying follows, leaving a final dry extract.

If you're adding mushrooms to your coffee, it's a good idea to limit your coffee intake to between 13:00 and 14:00. This will reduce the negative effects of caffeine on sleep quality. A good alternative to coffee is to drink mushrooms in tea.<br\/><br\/>Reishi, due to its tonic and calming properties on the nervous system, is worth taking in the evening, preferably with green tea or cocoa.<br\/>In the case of Chaga mushrooms, the time of consumption does not matter.<\/p>"
