They are used in mycelium products or mushroom biomass, which is a mixture of mycelium and fruiting bodies.<br\/><br\/>Active substances are also polysaccharides, but in a different configuration - Beta-D-glucans 1-3 and 1-6.

Since we do not have an enzyme that can effectively digest chitin - hot water extraction is fundamental to the bioavailability of fungal preparations. Alcohol, on the other hand, allows the extraction of water-insoluble compounds such as triterpenes.<br\/><br\/>Once the extract has been concentrated, spray drying follows, leaving a final dry extract.
