They are found in nature, especially in mushrooms, and are known for their strong ability to support and regulate the immune system. [2]Beta-D-glucans from mushrooms are considered to be more beneficial than those sourced from cereals like oats and barley, yeasts, or certain algae. This is due to their distinct structural features and the health advantages they offer. At Solve Labs, we exclusively utilise mushroom-sourced Beta-D-Glucans for these reasons. There are two key attributes that are particularly noteworthy about mushroom beta-d-glucans:<strong>MOLECULAR STRUCTURE<\/strong>=<strong>HIGHER BIO ACTIVITY<\/strong>Beta-D-glucans from mushrooms have a complex branching structure with β-(1,3) and β-(1,6) linkages. These is different from those found in grains, yeasts and algae. This branching pattern is believed to be responsible for their biological activity and potential health benefits.<strong>The unique molecular structure of mushroom beta-d-glucans allows them to interact with specific receptors in the immune system and exert immunomodulatory effects.<\/strong><\/p>"

Lion's Mane mushroom can provide all that and more.\n<\/p>\n<ul class=\"features-list list1\">\n   <li>\n      <strong>Enhanced Cognitive Function<\/strong> - Known to enhance cognitive function, Lion's Mane may help to improve memory, focus, and mental clarity. The vital bioactive compound found in Lion's Mane is Hericenones. Research indicates that this particular compound could help to improve cognitive function, stimulate neuronal growth and possibly even generate damaged cells. [1]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>NGF (Nerve Growth Factor)<\/strong> - Lion's mane mushroom is known for its ability to stimulate the production of Nerve Growth Factor (NGF). NGF is a protein that plays a crucial role in the growth, maintenance, and survival of neurons, both in the central and peripheral nervous systems. By promoting NGF production, Lion's Mane may support the development of new neurons and the overall health of the nervous system. [1] [9]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>Neuroprotection<\/strong> - Lion's mane mushroom exhibits incredible neuroprotective properties. It can help protect brain cells from damage caused by oxidative stress and inflammation. This neuroprotective effect contributes to long-term brain health and may potentially reduce the risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases later in life. We are pretty convinced that that isn’t a risk worth taking. [1] [3]\n   <\/li>\n   <li>\n      <strong>Mood & Mental Wellness<\/strong> - Lion's mane isn't just about cognition though. It's also your secret weapon for mood and mental well-being. By modulating neurotransmitters like serotonin and dopamine, lion’s mane helps to regulate your mood and emotions while reducing feelings of anxiety and depression. Studies have indicated that this is especially so for menopausal women. So, whether you're feeling low or just want to maintain your good mood, Lion's Mane can support a positive outlook and overall mental wellbeing. [1] [3]\n      \n       <\/li>\n<li>\n      <strong>Improved Brain-Gut-Axis<\/strong> - Nicknamed the \"second brain,\" the gut is replete with a vast neuron network, comparable in number to the spinal cord, ranging from 200 to 600 million. This neural web is intricately connected to the brain and is also the residence of two-thirds of the body's immune cells. So Mane mushroom has the potential to not only enhance cognitive function, but also gut health and mental well-being. Not to mention your immune system. [3]\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>"

They are found in nature, especially in mushrooms, and are known for their strong ability to support and regulate the immune system. [2]\n<br><br>\n\nBeta-D-glucans from mushrooms are considered to be more beneficial than those sourced from cereals like oats and barley, yeasts, or certain algae. This is due to their distinct structural features and the health advantages they offer. At Solve Labs, we exclusively utilise mushroom-sourced Beta-D-Glucans for these reasons. There are two key attributes that are particularly noteworthy about mushroom beta-d-glucans:\n\n\t<div class=\"recipes-block\" style=\"text-align: center;align-items: center;\">\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">MOLECULAR STRUCTURE<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<d style=\"font-size: 68px;\">=<\/d>\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                \n                    \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">HIGHER BIO ACTIVITY<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>\n                \n       Beta-D-glucans from mushrooms have a complex branching structure with β-(1,3) and β-(1,6) linkages. These is different from those found in grains, yeasts and algae. This branching pattern is believed to be responsible for their biological activity and potential health benefits.<strong> The unique molecular structure of mushroom beta-d-glucans allows them to interact with specific receptors in the immune system and exert immunomodulatory effects.<\/strong><br><br>"

Solve Labs Lion’s Mane is a 10:1 extract, meaning that for every gram of our extract, it's as if you're consuming ten grams of the pure mushroom. \n\n.<\/li>\n\t\t\t\t\t<li>\n\n\n<strong>Potency <\/strong>is therefore high thanks to the concentration of mushroom and active compounds. Solve Labs Lion’s Mane supplement is derived exclusively from 100% mature dry fruiting bodies, guaranteeing that you will receive the maximum benefits of the mushroom's natural properties.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>\nEqually important is the <strong>avoidance of fillers derived from starch and grains<\/strong>. These fillers not only dilute the concentration and potency of the active compounds but may also introduce unnecessary additives or allergens. It is, after all, Beta-D-Glucans 1,3 and 1,6 that we are after.\n\n<\/p>"

They're like nature's own 'cognitive enhancers', helping people to increase their focus and spark their creativity. Many people use nootropics to give their mental performance a little extra edge, whether they're tackling a challenging work task or diving into a creative endeavour. And the best part?

They are also believed to stimulate the production of nerve growth factor (NGF), which plays a crucial role in the growth and maintenance of brain cells.
