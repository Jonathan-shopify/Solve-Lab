Chaga is known to be one of the highest scoring foods on the ORAC scale and has the highest oxygen radical absorbance capacity of any natural food we know of. [16] \n<\/p> <p>Packed with essential B vitamins, including niacin (B3), riboflavin (B2), and pantothenic acid (B5). Chaga also provides a healthy dose of vitamin D, crucial minerals like potassium, selenium, iron, zinc, magnesium, and calcium. This nutrient-dense profile makes it stand out as a holistic nutritional source.\n<\/p>\n<div class=\"text-frm\">\n<div class=\"text-frm-img-block\">\n         <img src=\"https:\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0777\/0718\/2389\/files\/DSC_0434_1.png?v=1698015094\">\n <\/div>\n<div class=\"text-frm-txt-block\">\n<p>\nBut what truly sets Chaga apart is its content of ergosterol and melanins, along with the presence of superoxide dismutase (SOD), an enzyme known for its potent antioxidant properties. SOD is one of those unique endogenous antioxidants, typically produced by the body, but in this case, it's supplied by Chaga, enhancing its antioxidative capacity.\n\n<\/p>\n<p>\nAntioxidants, as we know, can come from dietary sources like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dark chocolate. However, the inclusion of SOD in Chaga elevates its status, combining the benefits of dietary antioxidants with the exceptional qualities of an internally produced enzyme.<\/p>\n<p>\nThis combination of vitamins, minerals, and specialized antioxidants positions Chaga as a comprehensive supplement for not just maintaining health and fighting oxidative stress but also for potentially you to feel and look younger, thanks to its cellular protective and anti-aging properties.\n<\/p>\n\n<\/div>\n<\/div>"

[2]\n\n<br><br>\n\nBeta-D-glucans from mushrooms are considered to be more beneficial than those sourced from cereals like oats and barley, yeasts, or certain algae. This is due to their distinct structural features and the health advantages they offer. At Solve Labs, we exclusively utilise mushroom-sourced Beta-D-Glucans for these reasons. There are two key attributes that are particularly noteworthy about mushroom beta-d-glucans:\n\n\t<div class=\"recipes-block\" style=\"text-align: center;align-items: center;\">\n                \n                \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">MOLECULAR STRUCTURE<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<d style=\"font-size: 68px;\">=<\/d>\n\t\t\t\t\n                    \n                \n                    \n\t\t\t\t\t<div class=\"recip-box\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<strong class=\"heading\">HIGHER BIO ACTIVITY<\/strong>\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\n\n<\/div>\n                \n       Beta-D-glucans from mushrooms have a complex branching structure with β-(1,3) and β-(1,6) linkages. These is different from those found in grains, yeasts and algae. This branching pattern is believed to be responsible for their biological activity and potential health benefits. <strong>The unique molecular structure of mushroom beta-d-glucans allows them to interact with specific receptors in the immune system and exert immunomodulatory effects.<\/strong><br>"

They are used in mycelium products or mushroom biomass, which is a mixture of mycelium and fruiting bodies.<br\/><br\/>Active substances are also polysaccharides, but in a different configuration - Beta-D-glucans 1-3 and 1-6.

Since we do not have an enzyme that can effectively digest chitin - hot water extraction is fundamental to the bioavailability of fungal preparations. Alcohol, on the other hand, allows the extraction of water-insoluble compounds such as triterpenes.<br\/><br\/>Once the extract has been concentrated, spray drying follows, leaving a final dry extract.

If you're adding mushrooms to your coffee, it's a good idea to limit your coffee intake to between 13:00 and 14:00. This will reduce the negative effects of caffeine on sleep quality. A good alternative to coffee is to drink mushrooms in tea.<br\/><br\/>Reishi, due to its tonic and calming properties on the nervous system, is worth taking in the evening, preferably with green tea or cocoa.<br\/>In the case of Chaga mushrooms, the time of consumption does not matter.<\/p>"
